### Task 1: Guessing Game  

#### Task Description  
Write a Python program that generates a random number between 1 and 100. 
The user should guess the number, and the program provides hints ("too high" or "too low") until the correct number is guessed.

#### How It Works
- The program generates a random number in the range [1, 100].
- The user provides guesses, and the program gives feedback until the correct number is guessed.

---

### Task 2: Number Guesser

#### Task Description
Create a number guessing game where the program generates a random number within a user-defined range. The program provides feedback ("too high" or "too low") until the correct guess is made.

#### How It Works
- The user specifies a range for the random number generation.
- The game behaves like the guessing game but adjusts to the custom range.

### Task 3: Password Strength Checker
#### Task Description
Write a Python function to evaluate the strength of a password based on:

- Length (at least 8 characters).
- Inclusion of uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Presence of digits and special characters.
The function categorizes the password as Weak, Moderate, or Strong.

#### How It Works
- Uses regex to evaluate various password characteristics.
- Aggregates strength criteria to categorize the password.

---

### Task 4: Fibonacci Sequence
#### Task Description
Write a Python function to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number of terms.

#### How It Works
- The first two terms of the sequence are pre-defined as [0, 1].
- The next terms are generated by summing the last two terms in the sequence.

---

### Task 5: File Manipulation
#### Task Description
Write a Python program that:

- Reads the content of a text file.
- Counts the occurrences of each word.
- Displays the results in alphabetical order.

#### How It Works
- Reads and processes the file content, handling potential errors (e.g., file not found).
- Cleans the text of punctuation before counting words.
- Displays word counts in alphabetical order for easy interpretation.

#### Results
